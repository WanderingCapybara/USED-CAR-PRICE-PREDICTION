# Used Car Price Prediction

## Objective
This project aims to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting the prices of used cars. The model is designed to provide significant advantages to both prospective buyers, who want to determine the true value of their desired pre-owned vehicle, and sellers, seeking to establish competitive pricing. It holds the potential to empower both consumers and sellers with the knowledge required to make well-informed choices in the process of buying or selling a pre-owned vehicle, thereby potentially mitigating the inherent uncertainty associated with such transactions.
